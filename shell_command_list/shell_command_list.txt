Compound Commands:

Looping Constructs: Shell commands for iterative action.
until
	The syntax of the until command is:
		until <test-command>; do <consequent-command>; done
	Execute consequent-command as long as test-command has an exit status which is not zero.
	The return status is the exit status of the last consequent-command executed, or zero if none was executed.
while
	The syntax of the while command is:
		while <test-command>; do <consequent-command>; done
	Execute consequent-command as long as test-command has an exit status of zero.
	The return status is the exit status of the last consequent-command executed, or zero if none was executed.
loop
	The syntax of the loop command is:
		loop <loop-count>; do <consequent-command>; done
	Execute consequent-command loop-count times.
	The return status is the exit status of the last consequent-command executed, or zero if none was executed.

Conditional Constructs: Shell commands for conditional execution.
if
	The syntax of the if command is:
		if <test-command>; then <consequent-command>; [else <alternate-consequent>;] fi
	The test-command is executed, and if its return status is zero, the consequent-command is executed.
	If 'else alternate-consequent' is present, and the final command in the if clause has a non-zero exit status,
	then alternate-consequent is executed.
	The return status is the exit status of the last command executed, or zero if no condition tested true.

Special Parameters:
$?	Expands to the exit status of the most recently executed command (used as <test-command>).
